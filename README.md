## Moleculer Go Examples

# WhatsApp Example App

A friend needed a whatsapp app to automate some of his social media campaings, I thought would be great to help him and at the same time help Moleculer Go with on more example app :)

So here it is.

I'm using the following components in this project:

- whatsapp lib: https://github.com/go-whatsapp
- UI: React with Next.js
- UI Theme: https://mdbootstrap.com/docs/react/components/demo/
